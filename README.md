# SillyLogin
 A login example made using PySide6 and several Python libraries.
 I'm taking suggestions for this example, so if you have any, feel free to contribute!

# To do
 This project is still somewhat unfinished. There are some small features that haven't been implemented.
 - Add custom user pictures for every account
 - More translations aside from English and Spanish
 - Add an example build. (PyInstaller)

# Building
 The following project needs you to have Qt 6.5 installed. You will also need PySide6 installed.
 You can check out the other packages and install them with the [requirements](requirements.txt) file.

# Modifying
 You are free to modify this project and use it in your own projects.
 The license used is the [GPL v3 license](LICENSE) as requested by the QT Framework project.

 If you have any issue or problem, file an issue and I'll try to figure it out.
